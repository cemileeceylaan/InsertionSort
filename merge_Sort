First of all, we need to divide two this array. [16,21,11],[8,12,22]. We need to divide two again.[16,21],[11],[8,12],[22].And finally we got [16][21][11][8][12][22].
But actually before one step, we can decide which number larger. 11 is compared to 16 and 21. -> [11,16,21]. And we apply same procedure others: we got [8,12,22].
After that, 8 and 11 compared. [8,11,16,21]. 12 is compared to 16 and 21.[8,11,12,16,21].22 is compared to 16 and 21. [8,11,12,16,21,22]
